# Sports Roster Project [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/3bb4e734-e16a-45b9-871e-68d42e6eaa69/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/sr-sports-roster/deploys)

## Motivation

This project was an excercise in using React to create basic a sports roster app with full CRUD. The aim was to gain a deeper understanding in React Router and integrating Firebase and Material UI. I used the LA Lakers as the mock sports team, however, this app can be used to manage other team you'd like.
